In today's rapidly developing internet environment, people face massive amounts of data every day, with text-based information occupying a significant proportion. Keyword extraction is a fundamental task when processing textual information. For example, from a personal perspective, knowing the keywords beforehand when reading an article can greatly help in grasping the main ideas. Moreover, in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), keyword extraction is foundational for many tasks. However, both manual and traditional statistical keyword extraction methods have their limitations. Realizing the excellent performance of deep learning in various fields, we conceived the idea of using the BERT model to develop a keyword extraction program based on TensorFlow. This aims to demonstrate the application potential of deep learning in keyword extraction tasks and provide a new technical pathway.
