<email> john bongiovanni subject summary borlandmicrosoft database c libraries organization orbital engine company lines <number> well im amazed successful exercise received <number> responses <number> requests summary thanks everyone made possible able find codebase accsys q+e codebase accsys c libraries without sql q+e windows application communicated windows dde calls send sql string receive results people wrote tell paradox engine borland products mentioned microsofts odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase q+e odbc quadbase rbase q+e sql decided codebase mostly ansi c portability version runs dos unix etc includes source code portability important application works dbase foxpro clipper files however feel microsofts odbc looks promising mostly formalisation building submitting sql queries formatting query results responses say available via ftp except effectively unusuable without two manuals odbc programmers reference odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesnt actually interpret sql liase databases thats drivers provided database manufacturers also windows actually extension windows sdk nevertheless start sql interface standard make life interesting future heres original post followed responses separated line asterisks > anyone know borland microsoft libraries accessing > respective databases paradox foxpro within c programs > id really like able build sql query string
