<email> andy collins subject voltage regulation current limiting organization university california berkeley lines <number> nntppostinghost uclinkberkeleyedu summary need help one notsoquick question throw guys class project need design build power supply following specs voltatge adjustable <number>00v current limited 0a voltage must stay within <number> designated value <number>0a ac ripple less <number> mv rms course cant use adjustable voltage currentlimiting regulator chip ^ problem current limiting ie weve found stuff rest parts circuit supply must presented load would draw 0a given supply voltage reduce voltage current equal one amp thus short thing ammeter read one amp measure current <number> ohm resistor 00v read one amp output voltage necessity must 0v basic idea seen current limiter involves circuit pull current base output power transistor therefore reduce output anybody ideas could work thanks advance andy collins kc0yey <email> ps anybody wants flame stupid project agree fully still graded ^
