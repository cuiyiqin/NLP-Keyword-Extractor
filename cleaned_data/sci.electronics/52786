<email> mr cd smith subject voltage multiplier problem organization computer science liverpool university lines <number> nntppostinghost goytcsclivacuk hi ive built valve preamp use diodecapacitor voltage multiplier step 00vac supply voltage approx 000vdv load resistance increases rc constant decreases hence output voltage drops need high output voltage possible 000v circuit consists seven voltage multiplier stages ie <number> diodes <number> capacitors capacitor develops 00v across take output across seven capacitors=000v capacitor 000mfd 00v increase capacitors rating <number>000mfd increase rc constant hence alleviate problem capacitors going little expensive need <number> <number> would happen connected 000mfd 000v capacitor parallel output hence parallel seven 000mfd capacitors assume increase c circuit hence increase rc time constant output voltage becomes stable killed two birds one stone experiencing 00hz ripple hence amp hum new capacitor smooth <number> anyone recomend suitable value inductor choke placed output line power supply filter 00hz mains hum lowest resistance possible ive got preamp moment much distraction im university ive got get dissertation finished two weeks hence im mailing playing solderoing iron itll cheaper long run especially <number> new large capacitors dont work planned email please cant always read net thanks advance chris +====================================================================+ |name mr chris smith | twang ole guitar | |addrs <email> | | |uni liverpool university |quest build hardware | |dgree computer science | | +====================================================================+ ever sun may certainly ball flaming gas dh lawrence views expressed reflect private thought
