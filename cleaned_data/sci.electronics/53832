<email> steve verity subject need help video detection circuit organization systemsnsoftware lines <number> trying build circuit detects presence video vs blank screen monitoring rg b outputs graphics card able detect presence single pixel <number> mhz would mean detecting <number> ns pulse also able tell difference blank screen <number> mv dim screen say around <number> mv oh yes also needs cheap first circuit dismal failure used <number> compariators compariator + input going one guns input went reference created voltage dividera potentiometer first problem compariator way slow needed get several pixels row would fire compariators could whole screen full text circuit would detect second problem noise reference smallest difference blank screen dim screen fact difference completely black completely white <number> mv wondering going amplify video signals make work faster compariators expensive require split supplies would need replace <number> quad compariator three <number> compariators create whole new power supply circuit point think need sort transistor circuit transistors fast cheap trick unfortunately way league comes designing transistor circuits appealing net help ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would greatly appreciated oh yes sample output thing every second dont need fast response time however havent found way take advantage fact thanks lot help anybody might able give course undying gratitude steve verity >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>+ steve verity + + maxed midi + + <email> + +
