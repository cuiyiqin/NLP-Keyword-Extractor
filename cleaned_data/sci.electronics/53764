<email> mark w kubovich subject commonmode noise small signals keywords noise common mode organization iowa state university ames ia lines <number> never worked really small signals questions low level noise noticed waveform synthesizer using analogic <number> relatively large common mode noise using synthesizer null another transient waveform amplifying difference ~000uv several hundred times <number> <number><number> mvpp common mode noise tends make measurements hard repeat noise quite sync line frequency spectrum analyzer main component 00hz get rid noise look spectrum using hp 0000a audio range analyzer noise goes away minute switch isolation input guessing anlayzer diff amp input since read accurately dc also use differential amplifier ia solve problem important use one shield drivers amp connected shield sort feedback loop remove trouble caused different cable capacitances anyone suggest good ic ia use transient signals content 0khz 000khz would appreciate
