detroit d bob mcgill 0th round pick <number> entry draft vancouver grade aa early slump garpenlov nothing short inspirational rest way finishing <number> points <number> games second highest total team clicked well team mvp kelly kisio right wing rob gaudreau kisio got credit garpenlov finishing second mvp voting clearly demonstrated playmaking scoring skills seen making excellent centering passes well finishing passes putting puck past opposing goaltenders getting clubhigh <number> power play goals contrary previous rep garpenlov also showed despite small size <number> <number> <number> lbs willing throw around necessary albeit successful yet also still needs work defense although improved tremendously throughout season actually quite good penalty killer end season major key offense next year <number> david bruce season 0th acquired <number><number> st louis expansion draft grade banner <number><number> led team powerplay goals <number> third total scoring <number> points <number> games bruce bothered virtually season groin injury kept lineup <number> games season course difficult speculate well would done season affected injury <number>yearold bruce effective man man short sharks first season expected strong offensive leader season well injury appears serious shame otherwise may much brighter future instead future sharks next season appears clouded <number> mark

<number> games riding pine early season pederson summarily sent sharks exchange defensiveminded snuggerud finished <number> games combined flyers sharks also limited injuries season limited production <number> points healthy pederson appears impressive good scoring touch good size willingness throw around although hes considered physical forward good speed also appear liability defense sharks probably wait next season see much exactly pederson <number> john carter season 0th acquired <number><number> free agent boston grade b+b carter definitely one hardest workers team hard work worked wonders times looked great ice however although look great times fact received <number> points <number> games efforts sign much hard work sharks confirmed sending kansas city <number> games left season carter turn <number> may <number> always hussled result sometimes trapped deep within offensive zone forechecking generally credit defensive end probably limited utility capacity impress offensively although one best sharks drawing penalties unlikely back next season <number> jeanfrancois quintin season 0st acquired <number><number> minnesota dispersal draft grade b+b dont understand sharks didnt let quintin play <number> games played season generally hardworking creating opportunities offensively appeared age <number> ready regular nhl duty least team like sharks finishing <number> points <number> games defensive liability shoulder injury training camp <number><number> season limited quintin teams leading scorer exhibition games despite sitting final two <number> games sharks blades season looked impressive solid contender regular duty next season <number> mark beaufait season 0st acquired 0nd round pick <number> supplemental draft grade allstar season kansas city beaufait got cup coffey sharks late season blades knocked playoff spot sharks decimated injuries playing <number> games scoring goal nhl point thus far despite small size <number> <number> <number>

jaroslav otevrel season 0st acquired 0th round pick <number> entry draft grade like beaufait otevrel also played away normal position cup tea <number> games midway season generally much defensive liability show much offensively either although may indicative lack ice time got <number> games may need another season work defense defense acceptable ready <number> michel picard season 0st acquired <number><number> trade hartford lw yvon corriveau grade bc+ <number>yearold picard although perennially tore minors seems close chances reason acquired sharks failing impress management <number> games scoring <number> goals points spent rest way kansas city particularly strong defensively despite offensive brilliance minors failed thus far score nhl although given limited opportunities may sharks bait expansion draft <number> dody wood season 0st acquired 0rd round pick <number> entry draft grade d+d although perhaps shouldnt give grade accused knocking wood much probably surprise thoroughly unimpressed wood thus far although <number> games small example generally nonfactor offense particularly good defensively took many silly penalties losing many fights process gathering <number> penalty minutes <number> games projecting <number> <number>game season hes ready needs least another season kc work fighting skills nothing else relatively small size <number> <number> <number> lbs
