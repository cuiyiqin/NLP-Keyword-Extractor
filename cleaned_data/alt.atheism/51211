perhaps biggest imperfection code full noncoding regions introns called intervene coding regions exons impressive amount evidence suggests introns ancient origin likely early exons represented early protein domains number introns decreasing increasing appears intron loss occur species common ancestry usually quite similar exonintron structure genes hand possibility introns inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns removed splicing mechanism would present unused introns inserted moreover intron insertion would required precise targeting random insertion would tolerated since sequences intron removal selfsplicing mrna conserved besides transposition sequence usually leaves trace long terminal repeats target site duplications found near intron sequences seriously recommend reading textbooks molecular biology genetics posting theological arguments like try watsons molecular biology gene darnell lodish baltimores molecular biology cell starters remember question posed theological context god cause disease newborns answer likewise theological perspective less valid purely scientific perspective different scientific perspective supported evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail fulfil criterion think misread meaning said god made genetic code perfect doesnt mean perfect certainly evolved since worse would please cite references support assertion assertion less valid scientific perspective unless support evidence fact claimed parasites diseases perhaps important weve thought instance sex might evolved defence parasites view supported computer simulations evolution eg tierra perhaps thought higher energy rays like xrays gamma rays cosmic rays caused damage fact thermal energy damage although usually mild easily fixed enzymatic action actually neither us knows atmosphere like time god created life according recollection biologists claim life began <number> billion years ago would half billion years earth created would still primitive support life seem remember figure like <number> <number> billion years ago origination life earth anyone better estimate id replace created formed since need invoke creator earth formed without one recent estimates age earth range <number> <number> billion years earliest signs life true fossils organic stromatolitelike layers date back <number> billion years would leave billion years first cells evolve im sorry cant give references based course evolutionary biochemistry attended >>dominion great feat satan genetically engineer >>diseases bacterialviral genetic although forces >>natural selection tend improve survivability species >>degeneration genetic code tends offset want true evidence supposed degeneration understand scotts reaction > excuse farfetched know must > jesting know pathogens know > point mutations know everything come > spontaneously response last statement neither may well believe accept fact cannot know hope dont forget evidence suggests everything come spontaneously evidence conclusion science one believe anything healthy sign doubt disbelieve right path walk take look evidence present ones conclusions prior theology use method therefore seriously doubt could ever come right conclusions >>human dna complex tends accumulate errors adversely >>affecting wellbeing ability fight disease >>simpler dna bacteria viruses tend become efficient >>causing infection disease bad combination hence >> newborns suffer genetic viral bacterial >>diseasesdisorders supposing purpose valid move bacteria viruses exist cause disease another manifests general principle evolution replication saves replicators degradiation efficient method dna survive replicate less efficient methods didnt make present last time please present evidence claim human dna degrading evolutionary processes people claimed opposite true suppressed selection thus bound degrade havent seen much evidence either claim ask relevant discussion answering johns question genetic diseases many bacterial viral diseases require babies develop antibodies gods fault original question say course nothing evil gods fault explanation work fails miserably may right fact dont know satan responsible neither suppose powerful evil like satan exists would inconceivable might responsible many ills affect mankind dont think could done much better job pun intended problem seems satan necessary explain diseases inevitable product evolution say seems like another bad inference actually youve done oversimplify said point summary words takes new context never said people meant presumably god punished getting diseases say free moral choices attendent consequences mankind chooses reject god people done since beginning expect god protect adverse events entropic universe expecting god exists expect leave us alone would also like hear believe choices indeed free interesting philosophical question answer clearcut seems consequences would expect rejecting allah oh admit perfect yet im working good library bookstore good starting point price tea china question provided answer biology genetics fine subjects important scientific endeavors explain god created set life processes dont explain behind creation life subsequent evolution behind proposition something supported evidence recommend books need invoke behind prime mover evidence whole universe come existence without intervention recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest people still insist thanks scotty fine sagely advice highly motivated learn nittygritty details biology genetics although im sure id find fascinating subject realize details change big picture god created life beginning ability change adapt environment im sorry evidence big picture need create anything capable adaptation come existence without supreme try reading pw atkins creation revisited freeman <number> petri petri pihko kempmp mathematics truth pihatie <number> c finououlufi physics rule sf<number>
