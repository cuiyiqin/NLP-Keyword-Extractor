nations isnt much difference except zechariah involves one animal asscolt matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthews version get comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two donkeys could inevitably lead theological proctological dilemma find account written earlier st mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses zechariah properly shows us matthew attempt use prophetic verses bungled excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden asses situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done mt <number> havent read mouth babes sucklings thou brought perfect praise likely matthew made response since

messiah king jesus mentioned seems one case matthews pen making convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said lord jesus said asked promised jewish messiahking descended jews agree king david jesus counters quoting psalms <number> lord said lord sit right hand put enemies feet taken face value jesus denying necessity davidic descent one assumes opposition answer course christian answer agrees trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature messiahking tempting believe one christian interested matters investigation problems jesuss time psalm thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah superior need look scriptures messiah see expected great king bringing jews times even better davids rule course jews listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christians worship problem lies meaning psalm error apparently several jews jesuss time also made one must remember various factions among jews often result different expectations messiahking jesus apparently

footstool yhvh sends forth mighty scepter zion rule midst foes people offer freely day lead host holy mountains priest order melchizedek forever word lord often mistakenly capitalised christian bibles denote divinity lord hebrew word adoni capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord generic term would use used often scriptures refer kings gd merely address respect nothing text imply word refers either divinity messiahking supposed written david certain title psalm translates either psalm david psalm david seems fitting assume written court poet davids covenant endorsement gd psalm written

christianity target jesuss question might expect matthew writes event ends embarrassing pharisees power pen moses jesus together along leave gospel story matthew momentarily see pseudoprophecy johns gospel gospel story john deserves special treatment seems far removed real events jesuss career told even matthew moment look one verse early church leaders founded religion jewish hopes messiah king

decided would claim fulfillment promise expanded promise preaching heavenly kingdom john <number> jc speaking father abraham rejoiced see day say glad would nice tie approval jesus abraham abraham knew nothing jesus messiah anything christian tried failed find event old testament corresponds johns little prophecy par course see st john making old testament backings like forerunner matthew many

betrayer messiah gd deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function presiding people shortly gd would send judah israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king james scholars potter precisely made matthews quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense zechariahs context whereas potters field totally unrelated whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthews track record one finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judass situation christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation judas high priests high priests would put money treasury worthless shepherd zechariah exactly opposite course average thursdaynight bible student prophecy presented matthew would taken new testament face value matthews work convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots jesus led away crucified mt <number><number> gave vinegar drink mingled gall tasted would drink crucified divided garments among casting lots might fulfilled spoken prophet parted garments among upon vesture cast lots first vinegar offered jesus actually common sour wine type roman soldiers drank regularly find right jesus dies soldiers give drink polluted gall jn <number><number> jesus said thirst bowl vinegar stood put sponge full vinegar hyssop held mouth received vinegar said finished matthew seems drawing passage prophets one psalms ps <number><number> looked pity none comforters found none gave poison food lit put gall meat thirst gave vinegar drink add punishment upon punishment may acquittal thee let blotted book living course sour wine offered jesus done request drink indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david political military enemies messiah jesus surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks gd damnation crucifiers whereas jesus gospels says lk <number> jesus said father forgive dont know matthew misses attempt create prophecy gall bitter substance put jesuss drink meat psalm stipulates prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask casting lots brings 00nd psalm deserves discussion suffice say fact jesuss clothes divided told great thing turns happened often felon days soon see perhaps least erroneous passage psalm applied jesus indeed bring interesting question quality jesuss clothes man removed worldly possessions ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises suspicions 00nd psalm psalm attributed david lament condition attack enemies becomes song praise yhvh hope taken context parts seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well examine primary passages verse <number><number> god god forsaken far helping far words groaning oh god cry day dont answer night find rest jesus said cried first sentence cross suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david course rest first stanza fit nicely jesus execution jesus pictured complaining whole ordeal supposed like lamb led mute shearers indeed jesus doesnt much groaning even cross certainly cry day night cross <number><number> worm man scorned men see mock make faces wag heads committed cause yhvh let deliver delights seems fit jesuss execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm

thought unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw words pierced really exist psalm correct hebrew translation <number> yea dogs round company evildoers encircles like lion hands feet hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierced differ one phonetic character word hebrew text literally like lion kaari makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian

<number> psalm lend jesus easily verse <number> speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalms true subject king david side note know crucifixions pierce hands palms rather forearms doesnt say much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciples scars palms facts arent bound religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability time attempt draw many direct links psalm
