improving general level debate logic science reasoning proof thinking inference concise oed logic allows us analyze piece reasoning determine whether correct valid invalid course one need study logic order reason correctly nevertheless little basic knowledge logic often helpful constructing analyzing argument note claim made whether logic universally applicable matter much open debate document merely explains use logic given already decided logic right tool job propositions statements building blocks logical argument proposition statement either true false example raining today tuesday propositions may either asserted said true denied said false note technical meaning deny everyday meaning proposition meaning statement particular arrangement words used express god exists exists god express proposition argument quote monty python sketch connected series statements establish definite proposition argument consists three stages first propositions necessary argument continue stated called premises argument evidence reasons accepting argument conclusions premises assertions often indicated phrases since obviously phrase obviously often viewed suspicion used intimidate others accepting suspicious premises something doesnt seem obvious dont afraid question always say oh yes youre right obvious youve heard explanation next premises used derive propositions process known inference inference one proposition arrived basis one propositions already accepted various forms valid inference propositions arrived inference may used inference inference often denoted phrases implies therefore finally arrive conclusion argument proposition affirmed basis premises inference conclusions often indicated phrases therefore follows conclude conclusion often stated final stage inference example every event cause premise universe beginning premise beginnings involve event premise implies beginning universe involved event inference therefore universe cause inference conclusion note conclusion one argument might premise another argument proposition called premise conclusion respect particular argument terms make sense isolation sometimes argument follow order given example conclusions might stated first premises stated afterwards support conclusion perfectly valid sometimes little confusing recognizing argument much harder recognizing premises conclusions many people shower writing assertions without ever producing anything one might reasonably describe argument statements look like arguments example bible accurate jesus must either insane evil liar son god argument conditional statement assert premises necessary support appears conclusion also suffers number logical flaws well come later another example god created therefore duty god phrase duty god proposition since neither true false therefore conclusion sentence argument finally causality important consider statement form b interested establishing b offered evidence statement argument trying establish truth b argument explanation example must something wrong engine car start argument car start something wrong engine explanation two traditional types argument deductive inductive deductive argument one provides conclusive proof conclusions argument premises true conclusion must also true deductive argument either valid invalid valid argument defined one premises true conclusion true inductive argument one premises provide evidence truth conclusion inductive arguments valid invalid however talk whether better worse arguments probable premises forms argument ordinary language neither deductive inductive however concentrate moment deductive arguments often viewed rigorous convincing important note fact deductive argument valid imply conclusion holds slightly counterintuitive nature implication must consider carefully obviously valid argument consist true propositions however argument may entirely valid even contains false propositions example insects wings premise woodlice insects premise therefore woodlice wings conclusion conclusion true arguments premises false arguments premises true however conclusion would true argument thus entirely valid subtly reach true conclusion one false premises fish live sea premise dolphins fish premise therefore dolphins live sea conclusion however one thing cannot reach false conclusion valid inference true premises therefore draw truth table implication symbol => denotes implication premise b conclusion f represent true false respectively premise conclusion inference b =>b f f premises false inference f valid conclusion true false f f premises true conclusion false inference must invalid premises true inference valid conclusion must true sound argument valid argument whose premises true sound argument therefore arrives true conclusion careful confuse valid arguments sound arguments delve structure logical arguments would require lengthy discussion linguistics philosophy simpler probably useful summarize major pitfalls avoided constructing argument pitfalls known fallacies everyday english term fallacy used refer mistaken beliefs well faulty reasoning leads beliefs fair enough logic term generally used refer form technically incorrect argument especially argument appears valid convincing purposes discussion define fallacy logical argument appears correct seen incorrect examined closely studying fallacies aim avoid misled following list fallacies intended exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal force appeal force committed arguer resorts force threat force order try push acceptance conclusion often used politicians summarized might makes right force threatened need direct threat arguer example thus ample proof truth bible refuse accept truth burn hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem literally argument directed man abusive variety argumentum ad hominem occurs instead trying disprove truth assertion arguer attacks person people making assertion invalid truth assertion depend upon goodness asserting example atheism evil philosophy practised communists murderers sometimes court law doubt cast upon testimony witness showing example known perjurer valid way reducing credibility testimony given witness argumentum ad hominem however demonstrate witnesss testimony false conclude otherwise fall victim argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere list circumstantial form argumentum ad hominem committed person argues opponent ought accept truth assertion opponents particular circumstances example perfectly acceptable kill animals food argue otherwise youre quite happy wear leather shoes abusive charge inconsistency used excuse dismissing opponents argument fallacy also used means rejecting conclusion example course would argue positive discrimination bad thing youre white particular form argumentum ad hominem one alleges ones adversary rationalizing conclusion formed selfish interests also known poisoning well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means argument ignorance fallacy occurs whenever argued something must true simply proved false equivalently argued something must false proved true note assuming something false proved true basic scientific principle examples course bible true nobody prove otherwise course telepathy psychic phenomena exist nobody shown proof real note fallacy apply court law one generally assumed innocent proven guilty also scientific investigation known event would produce certain evidence occurred absence evidence validly used infer event occur example flood described bible would require enormous volume water present earth earth tenth much water even count frozen ice poles therefore flood occurred science validly assume lack evidence something occurred cannot conclude certainty occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam appeal pity also known special pleading fallacy committed arguer appeals pity sake getting conclusion accepted example murder mother father axe please dont find guilty im suffering enough orphan argumentum ad populum known appealing gallery appealing people commit fallacy attempt win acceptance assertion appealing large group people form fallacy often characterized emotive language example pornography must banned violence women bible must true millions people know trying tell mistaken fools argumentum ad numeram fallacy closely related argumentum ad populum consists asserting people support believe proposition likely proposition correct argumentum ad verecundiam appeal authority uses admiration famous try win support assertion example isaac newton genius believed god line argument always completely bogus example reference admitted authority particular field may relevant discussion subject example distinguish quite clearly stephen hawking concluded black holes give radiation john searle concluded impossible build intelligent computer hawking physicist reasonably expect opinions black hole radiation informed searle linguist questionable whether wellqualified speak subject machine intelligence fallacy accident fallacy accident committed general rule applied particular case whose accidental circumstances mean rule inapplicable error made one goes general specific example christians generally dislike atheists christian must dislike atheists fallacy often committed moralists legalists try decide every moral legal question mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization fallacy reverse fallacy accident occurs one forms general rule examining specific cases representative possible cases example jim bakker insincere christian therefore christians insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter sweeping generalization occurs general rule applied particular situation features particular situation render rule inapplicable sweeping generalization opposite hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc known false cause fallacies fallacy non causa pro causa occurs one identifies something cause event actually shown cause example took aspirin prayed god headache disappeared god cured headache fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs something assumed cause event merely happened event example soviet union collapsed taking atheism therefore must avoid atheism reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy similar post hoc ergo propter hoc asserts two events occur together must causally related leaves room factors may causes events petitio principii fallacy occurs premises least questionable conclusion reached circulus demonstrando fallacy occurs one assumes premise conclusion one wishes reach often proposition rephrased fallacy appears valid argument example homosexuals must allowed hold government office hence government official revealed homosexual lose job therefore homosexuals anything hide secret open blackmail therefore homosexuals cannot allowed hold government office note argument entirely circular premise conclusion argument like actually cited reason british secret services official ban homosexual employees another example classic know god exists bible tells us know bible true word god complex question fallacy interrogation fallacy presupposition one example classic loaded question stopped beating wife question presupposes definite answer another question even asked trick often used lawyers crossexamination ask questions like hide money stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions long ec interference affairs allowed continue chancellor plan two years ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi fallacy irrelevant conclusion consists claiming argument supports particular conclusion actually logically nothing conclusion example christian may begin saying argue teachings christianity undoubtably true argues length christianity great help many people matter well argues shown christian teachings true sadly fallacious arguments often successful arouse emotions cause others view supposed conclusion favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs key word used two different meanings argument example could affordable free software make sure remains free users like must place license make sure always freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs premises used argument ambiguous careless ungrammatical phrasing accent accent another form fallacy shifting meaning case meaning changed altering parts statement emphasized example consider speak ill friends speak ill friends fallacies composition one fallacy composition conclude property shared parts something must apply whole example bicycle made entirely low mass components therefore lightweight fallacy composition conclude property number individual items shared collection items example car uses less petrol causes less pollution bus therefore cars less environmentally damaging buses fallacy division fallacy division opposite fallacy composition like opposite exists two varieties first assume property thing must apply parts example studying rich college therefore must rich assume property collection items shared item example ants destroy tree therefore ant destroy tree slippery slope argument argument states one event occur harmful events proof made harmful events caused first event example legalize marijuana would legalize crack heroin well nation full drugaddicts welfare therefore cannot legalize marijuana based b fallacies type fallacies fallacies occur one attempts argue things way similar without actually specifying way similar examples isnt history based upon faith isnt bible also form history islam based faith christianity based faith isnt islam form christianity cats form animal based carbon chemistry dogs form animal based carbon chemistry arent dogs form cat affirmation consequent fallacy argument form implies b b true therefore true understand fallacy examine truth table implication given earlier denial antecedent fallacy argument form implies b false therefore b false truth table implication makes clear fallacy note fallacy different non causa pro causa latter form implies b false therefore b false fact imply b problem implication invalid rather falseness allow us deduce anything b converting conditional fallacy argument form b therefore b argumentum ad antiquitam fallacy asserting something right good simply old thats way always argumentum ad novitam opposite argumentum ad antiquitam fallacy asserting something correct simply new newer something else argumentum ad crumenam fallacy believing money criterion correctness money likely right argumentum ad lazarum fallacy assuming someone poor sounder virtuous one wealthier fallacy opposite argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam incorrect belief assertion likely true often heard argumentum ad nauseum one employs constant repetition asserting something bifurcation also referred black white fallacy bifurcation occurs one presents situation two alternatives fact alternatives exist exist plurium interrogationum many questions fallacy occurs questioner demands simple answer complex question non sequitur nonsequitur argument conclusion drawn premises logically connected red herring fallacy committed irrelevant material introduced issue discussed everyones attention diverted away points made towards different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs abstract concept treated concrete thing shifting burden proof burden proof always person making assertion proposition shifting burden proof special case argumentum ad ignorantium fallacy putting burden proof person denies questions assertion made source fallacy assumption something true unless proven otherwise straw man straw man fallacy misrepresent someone elses position attacked easily knock misrepresented position conclude original position demolished fallacy fails deal actual arguments made extended analogy fallacy extended analogy often occurs suggested general rule argued fallacy assume mentioning two different situations argument general rule constitutes claim situations analogous fallacy best explained using real example debate anticryptography legislation believe always wrong oppose law breaking position odious implies would supported martin luther king saying cryptography legislation important struggle black liberation dare tu quoque famous fallacy occurs action argued acceptable party performed instance youre randomly abusive youve abusive y
