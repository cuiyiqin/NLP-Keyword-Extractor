teleoperation model one ltm0 ========================================= david h mitchell march <number> <number> introduction order increase public interest spacebased lunar operations real miniature lunarlike environment constructed test teleoperated models models remotelycontrolled individuals located worldwide using personal computers edutainment purposes provide testbed simple teleoperation telepresence activities also provides sharing information methods operating space including limited layout lunar colony teleoperating machines work play disseminating educational information providing contests awards creativity achievement provides new way students worldwide participate twentyfirst century remote learning methods nature ltm0 project people ages interests skills contribute scenery murals models structures interfacing electronics software graphics operation ltm0 evolving playground laboratory used children students professionals worldwide using personal computer home terminal participating institution user able teleoperate real models ltm0 base experimental recreational purposes real facility exists ample opportunity provided media coverage construction lunar model operation new features added suggested users broad inherent interest wide range groups teleoperations virtual reality research radio control model railroad ham radio operation astronomy space

graphical communications package modify control machineslets initial ground breaking miniature shovels performed live photosession news conference april <number> <number> initial models put place timelapse record started historical purposes expected event completely serious solemn lunar colony declared open additional building operations experiments photographer present photographs taken converted gif images distribution worldwide major online networks bbss press release issued calling contributions ideas time talent materials scale models simulated lunar colony contest new designs techniques working moon announced universities invited participate goal find instructors wish class participation various aspects lunar colony model field trips ltm0 arranged time results class work added model contributors able teleoperate contributed machinelets return campus monthly ltm0 newsletter issued electronically online via conventional means media major new teleoperated equipment addition marked invitation television news media large real model space colony attractive photo opportunity television community especially since action controlled people world science fiction writers invited issue challenges engineering human factors students universities build operate teleoperated equipment perform lunar tasks using counterweight pulley systems <number><number> gravity may simulated extent try various traction challenges long term goal creating worldwide interest education experimentation remote operation lunar colony ltm0 potential long term global edutainment method space activities may generic example teach explore many subject areas limited space edutainment facilitates kind spirit lead generation people ready leap stars conclusion edutainment blending education entertainment anyone ever enjoyed seeing miniatures probably see potential impact globally available layout recreation education experimentation purposes creating teleoperated model lunar colony create worldwide publicity also method trying new ideas require real virtual skills open new method putting peoples minds space moonlighters illuminating path knowledge space lunar development
