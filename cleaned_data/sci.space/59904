sufficient assure launch tower clearance achieved tilt maneuver roll program orients vehicle heads attitude required generate negative qalpha turn alleviates structural loading advantages attitude performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved sband look angles crew view horizon tilt maneuver also required start gaining downrange velocity achieve main engine cutoff meco target second stage really good answer couched nasa jargon ill try interpret <number> wait shuttle clears tower rolling <number> roll shuttle around angle attack wind caused passage atmosphere relative wind chord wings imaginary line leading edge trailing edge slightly negative angle negative qalpha causes little bit downward force toward belly orbiter +z direction force alleviates structural loading careful wings theyre delicate part vehicle <number> new attitude roll also allows us carry mass orbit achieve higher orbit mass change orbit higher lower inclination would case didnt roll performance gain <number> new attitude allows crew fly less complicated flight path execute one dangerous abort maneuvers return launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity <number> new attitude improves ability groundbased radio antennae good lineofsight signal sband radio antennae orbiter improved sband look angles <number> new attitude allows crew see horizon helpful mandatory part piloting flying machine <number> new attitude orients shuttle body nearly parallel ground nose east usually allows thrust engines add velocity correct direction eventually achieve orbit remember velocity vector quantity made speed direction shuttle large horizontal component velocity small vertical component attain orbit begs question isnt launch pad oriented give nice attitude begin shuttle need roll achieve attitude answer pads leftovers apollo days shuttle straddles two flame trenches one solid rocket motor exhaust one space shuttle main engine exhaust see effects daytime launch srm exhaust dirty gray garbage ssme exhaust fluffy white steam watch difference top orbiter side bottom external tank side stack access tower support service structure oriented basically way saturn vs side note saturn vs also roll program dont ask im shuttle guy checked buddy ascent dynamics added roll maneuver really maneuver three axes roll pitch yaw roll component maneuver performed reasons stated pitch component controls loading wings keeping angle attack qalpha within tight tolerance yaw component used determine orbital inclination total maneuver really expressed quaternion gradlevelmath concept
