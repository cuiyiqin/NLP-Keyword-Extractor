journal medicine study compared homicide rates seattle vancouver suggested handgun ban may reduce rate homicide community nine medical doctors published handgun regulations crime assaults homicide essentially reasoned three steps <number> despite many historical social demographic similarities <number> vancouver markedly lower homicide rate <number> stricter gun regulations make guns less available second step reasoning seems indisputable overall homicide rate seattle period <number><number> <number> per <number> popuation compared <number> vancouver homicide definitely common seattle question becomes authors present believable although entirely accurate case support notion claimed third step reasoning vancouvers handgun regulations much stringent evidence difference gun availabilty indirect unpersuasive indeed acknowledge direct evidence point exist offer two fragments inferential data support claim guns available seattle anybody knows matter empirical fact opposite could true therefore asked conclusion study believe difference gun availability explains difference homicide rates difference gun availability established indeed situation even troublesome first two indirect bits evidence difference number concealed weapons permits issued seattle number restrictedweapons permits issued vancouver differences two cities permit regulations render two numbers strictly noncomparable second bit evidence cooks gun prevalence index stands <number> percent seattle <number> percent vancouver cooks index however measure relative prevalence gun ownership various

firearms availability must assumed proportional involvement guns homicides suicides directly related relative availability general population exactly authors seeking prove assume one seeking prove prove basis assumption ot constitute scientific evidence anything even grant basis compelling evidence guns less common vancouver might still question causes authors attribute seattles higher crime rate higher rate gun ownership might well argued low crime homicide rates reduce motivation average citizens obtain gunsin words crime rates explain variation gun ownership vice versa fact commonly
