<number> enhanced mode windows <number> install program automatically configure dos windows use adaptec <number> however case something went wrong im going describe changes needed get windows <number> working <number> also may noticed installing windows <number> makes pc run much slower even youre running windows methods speeding discussed section called windows <number> runs slowly msdos configuration windows install program adds smartdrive disk cache configsys autoexecbat files follow instructions youll notice youll need use doublebuffering smartdrive default setup youll also notice system runs much much slower windows msdos see section called windows <number> runs slowly ways speeding system windows configuration get adaptec <number> work windows make sure 000enh section systemini file contains entry virtualhdirq= believe windows install program automatically adds entry systemini im sure doesnt work might want try adding lines virtualhdirq= systemrombreakpoint=false emmexclude=a000cfff probably dont need lines though systemrombreakpoint entry used enable support memory managers like qemm000max needed use programs windows <number> runs slowly get windows <number> running <number> chances system running much slower probably <number> happen using aspi0dossys version <number> configsys file congratulations appears winning solution <number> lucky whether luck hold remains seen system running much slower almost definitely caused smartdrive doublebuffering according windows documentation microsoft technical note q00000 smartdrive double buffering required aspi0dossys must use smartdrive doublebuffering enabled works really slows pc estimated slowed pc factor <number> five consider unacceptable looked solutions unfortunately cannot disable doublebuffering windows <number> enhanced mode work might even destroy contents hard disk trying run windows <number> one following <number> use drivers provide doublebuffering opinion unbelievable slowness smartdrive caused either horribly inefficient doublebuffering bug smartdrive <number> use driver provides vds services vds stands virtual dma services standard supported windows <number> allows busmastering disk controllers like <number> work windows trashing hard disk countless times found following solutions none require using smartdrive note however getting occasional parity errors probably caused solutions might see following require smartdrive using kind disk cache utility strongly recommended makes windows run much much faster <number> aspi0dossys driver need aspi functions controlling cdrom tape drive two physical hard disks etc add scsihasys driver configsys file eg driver=cscsihasys v000 windows needs v000 option driver must loaded low memory cannot loaded high memory occupies <number>00k november <number> scsihasys driver could obtained adaptec bbs <phone> hopefully still <number> need aspi functions aspi0dossys driver version <number> <number>0a use aspi0dossys scsihasys drivers configsys file eg driver=caspi0dossys driver=cscsihasys v000 amazingly enough scsihasys driver also loaded high assuming dos <number> would thought would crash system doesnt asked adaptecs technical support said loading scsihasys high fine long aspi0dossys loaded low system using scsihasys aspi0dos <number>0a would occasionally cause windows <number> crash upon restarting exiting windows additional result corrupted disk cwindowsgrp files would corrupted crashes usually occurred making different program progmanexe default windows shell viceversa reason scsihasys may necessary absolutely idea scsihasys necessary versions aspi0dos earlier <number> note many people use aspi0dos <number> <number>0a without scsihasys seem problems consider people lucky others like sorts problems <number> opinion best necessarily easiest solution upgrade aspi0dos <number> scsihasys driver longer needed unfortunately could get previous aspi0dos upgrades adaptec bbs aspi0dos <number> driver available adaptec bbs far know three ways get copy buy new november <number> adaptec ez scsi driver kit supposedly includes aspi0dos <number> well drivers cdrom drivers believe list price around <cur><number> already copy older version aspi0dos supposedly contact adaptec upgrade ez scsi around <cur><number> copy aspi0dos <number> included central point pc tools <number> msdos note documentation driver stored different directories note aspi0dos included cdrom drivers drivers support two hard disks included obtained copy aspi0dos <number> note however getting occasional parity errors windows probability defective hardware pc causing upgraded motherboard found solutions however parity errors occur disk accesses small definite possibility parity errors driverrelated example changing bus onoff timing certain disk transfers might cause ive run various memory tests hours time tests found problems problem probably caused memory marginal timing requirements cause parity errors disk transfers memory tests didnt find problems problems show disk io however im mentioning case isnt hardware problem floppycontrollerbased tape backup devices two possible problems using adaptec <number> floppycontrollerbased tape backup device colorado memory systems jumbo <number> <number> tape backupsrestores take long time tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc <number> tape operations may erratic encounter many tape errors problem might caused defective hardware <number> however ive heard people similar problems im mentioning case hardware problem <number> tape backupsrestores take long time floppycontrollerbased tape backup device may adjust adaptec <number><number> bus onoff timing best results using tape drive normally tape backup restore tape drive motor continuously running occasional pause however default bus timing adaptec <number><number> may cause tape drive motor start stop start stop every seconds causes needless wear tape tape drive however note dirty tape head defective tape drive also cause make sure tape heads clean also causes tape backup restore take much much longer necessary problem tape backups use floppy dma transfer data memory tofrom tape drive adaptec uses dma transfer data memory tofrom hard disk floppy dma needs feed data tape drive certain rate tape drive fed data quickly enough floppy dma tape drive stops rewinds bit restarts enough data eventually fed default bus timing adaptec really dma timing large example backup done data transferred hard disk memory memory tape default timing adaptec hogs memory much much time spent transferring data hard disk memory enough time spent transferring data memory tape drive result tape drive constantly starts stops data fed quickly enough solution change adaptecs bus onoff timing default factory setting <number> microseconds <number> microseconds bus timing needs lowered <number><number> microseconds done one two ways aspi0dos use n option example use bus timing <number> microseconds means use following line configsys file device=cspi0dossys n0 note space n <number> dont aspi0dos recourse try find program called setscsiexe difficult find reason adaptec reasons seem want widely distributed asked someone worked adaptec asked upload anywhere anonymous ftp access internet could try using archie hunt copy believe couple sites find copy run like setscsi n<number> adjusts bus timing <number> microseconds running setscsiexe without arguments resets bus timing back factory defaults note seems cannot use setscsiexe use aspi0dos setscsiexe crashed system aspi0dos loaded could use setscsiexe scsihasys however lower bus timing <number> microseconds increase <number> microseconds lower low hard disk throughput suddenly drop system feel slower <number> microseconds works fine value may work fine may adjust downwards little youve lowered bus timing tape backups restores run faster also experiment bus onoff times options intentionally described unless know bad combinations cause parity errors worse starving memory refresh program called bustifixexe exists adaptec bbs unless upgraded since last checked selfextracting archive containing batch file couple files batch file supposed allow one set bus onoff times <number><number> others however tried running program 0000a system crashed time running scsihasys didnt check see conflict maybe old program works 0000b although docs say works 0000a erratic tape operations many tape errors problem may may exist although existed system hardware problem particular <number> could cause however ive heard people similar problems im mentioning case isnt hardware problem <number> symptoms problem persists even cleaning tape head <number> backing tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting aborted tape backup <number> tape backup works tape compare fails <number> tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much often unlike abovementioned problem tape backupsrestores take long time tape drive starts stops every seconds kind startingstopping occurs every <number><number> seconds <number> fastback plus <number> findsee tape backup devices programs like central point backup cms jumbo software assuming cms jumbo <number> tape drive findsee tape drive fastback plus <number> cannot <number> many tape read errors although know causing problem discovered using different floppy controller solves months ago upgraded motherboard contained integrated floppy controller already floppy controller <number> initially disabled motherboard floppy controller decided try disabling <number> floppy controller using one motherboard tape drive cms jumbo <number> reliability increased dramatically fastback plus <number> suddenly able find use tape drive dont know caused hardware problem <number> one hand floppy drives worked great attached <number> seems say nothing wrong <number> hand tape drive didnt work well attached <number> floppy controller work attached different controller could indication hardware problem <number> change floppy drive cables conceivable problem cables dont know cause really however youre similar problems might want consider trying new floppy controller sound cards many popular sound cards play record digitized sound typically done using dma like tape drive dma adaptecs dma conflict sound card dma unlike tape dma conflict usually manifests parity error system crashes parity error message happens data transferred quickly sound card adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough causes parity error usually getting parity error means hardware problem system case however parity error symptom bad hardware ive found parity errors typically occur recording digitized sound chances errors increase increase recording fidelity eg higher sampling rate recording stereo recording using <number>bits instead <number> etc like tape drive solution solution lower adaptecs bus timing see section tape drives information done note however may may solve problem may reduce probability parity error software used record digitized sound greatly affect problem ie software inefficient disk caches speed hard disk amount disk fragmentation also affect miscellaneous info section contains miscellaneous hints tips rumors much merely information ive heard read verified believe following information correct im sure use risk qemm <number> <number> <number> need specify db= parameter eg db=<number> unless using aspi0dos driver dont qemm crashhang bootup although qemm manual mentions install program seem detect <number> present automatically add option qemm command line least occurred qemm <number> install program havent tested version earlier versions qemm probably need parameter im sure ive never used version earlier <number> use aspi0dos need give qemm db= parameter versions <number> support hard disks one gigabyte size support hard disks capacities 0gb need get new rom bios adaptec im sure still true latest 0000bs sold adaptec connect cdrom drive <number> need scsi cdrom drive drivers note cdrom drives proprietary interfaces nonscsi drives cannot used <number> three choices cdrom drivers idea well following solutions work even work following secondhand information <number> buy adaptecs ez scsi driver package lists something like <cur><number> already older adaptec drivers supposedly upgrade ez scsi around <cur><number> contact adaptec details ez scsi package supposedly contains everything need <number> buy corelscsi driver package made people make coreldraw package contains cdrom drivers scsi tape drivers worm drivers etc know list price ive seen package sold around <cur><number><cur><number> note corelscsi come aspi0dos driver needed already aspi0dos may better getting adaptecs ez scsi instead <number> method obsolete following drivers obsoleted adaptecs ez scsi kit im mentioning case someone already drivers use drivers adaptec asw<number> kit aspi0dos asw<number> kit aspi cdrom drivers get copy mscdexexe highlevel cdrom driver included asw<number> kit available several bulletin boards use scsi tape drive <number> need software knows talk scsi tape drive software ive heard like section cdrom drives idea well following solutions work even work following secondhand information <number> central point pc tools <number> msdos supposedly supports large number scsi tape drives comes scsi drivers aspi0dos <number> well central point backup <number> corelscsi driver package contains scsi tape backup program see section cdrom drives details however note corelscsi come
